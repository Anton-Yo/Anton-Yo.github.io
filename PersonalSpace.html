                In Personal Space, the player must navigate a small procedurally generated galaxy while avoiding spaceships trying to enter your atmosphere. A bit of a bizarre theme, but the theme was Re-Entry, so why not play as the planet trying to avoid that very thing?
                The only way to escape? Blow up the sun to create a black hole. 
                <br><br>
                This game was developed over 5 days in <a href="https://itch.io/jam/mq-reentry-game-jam" class="white-text-link" target="_blank"> Macquarie University's Re-entry Game Jam</a>.
                For the second year in a row, my team and I won the People's Choice award.

            <h4> My Contributions: </h4>
            <ul class="small-contribution-list">
                <li> Creative Director & Producer
                    <ul> 
                        <li> I came up with the subversive take on the theme and brainstormed it with the team. I was then responsible for maintaining the project scope and vision, while managing the workloads of the other team members  </li> 
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li> Procedural Generation 
                    <ul> 
                        <li> Having completed another project on procedural generation, I decided a procedurally generated galaxy would be a good idea. In a Game Jam.
                             Of course, some compromises had to be made, for simplicity and for the game's overall goal of finding the sun </li> 
                        <li> In the end, I wrote a generation script to create a 360 x 360 grid and populate it with planets of various sizes, and asteroid fields of varying scale/rotation </li>
                        <li> The most difficult part of this generation was preventing the astral bodies from intercepting each other. I checked for other objects in a scaled circle around the generated spawn point, and re-randomised if they intercepted </li>
                        <li> Designated the player spawn point as one of the outer quadrants near the bounds of the play area </li>
                        <li> The script spawns objects around the sun object, which is always at the center </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li> Smaller Tasks
                    <ul> 
                        <li> Implemented the enemy ship spawn system and player movement </li> 
                        <li> Sourced and implemented the audio, using 3D spatialised audio for the spaceship explosions </li>
                        <li> Created particles effects for ship explosion and planet movement </li>
                        <br>
