            You're trying to take treasure from the Pirate Lord?? I've been searching for the Barangaroo Treasure for ages and I 
            will not let anyone else have it. My little birdie on your ship has made sure that you’re not leaving anywhere with my treasure and stolen the key. Now you'll never find your precious key, and without the key, the treasure is useless! Make sure to get your surrender flag ready when I come along, otherwise you will not enjoy what’s coming. The Brandino will be mine and your meddlesome crew will be sold into slavery never to sail the seas freely again! </em></p>
